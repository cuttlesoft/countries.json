This repository hosts a rich dataset featuring countries, their ISO standard codes, subdivisions, and localized names for those subdivisions. It also includes data on whether a postal code system exists for the country and the common name for it. Each country data is represented as a JSON object and organized in a directory by the country's two-digit ISO code.

The repository provides a JavaScript helper file for easy integration into web applications.

## üì¶ Install

You can install this module directly from the npm registry:

```bash
npm install @cuttlesoft/countries.json
```

## ‚ú® Features

- **Comprehensive Country Data**
  
  The repository hosts an extensive dataset with country-specific details including country name, subdivisions, and postal codes, all in compliance with ISO standards.

- **Easy Integration**

  A JavaScript helper function is included that lets you quickly import and utilize the data in your web application.

- **Localization Ready**

  The data set includes localized names for subdivisions and postal codes, perfect for creating localization features in your application.

## Use Cases

This dataset can be leveraged in multiple ways:

1. **Dynamic and localized forms:** Use the dataset to create dynamic forms that change based on the selected country. For example, when a user selects their country, you can show relevant subdivisions and check if postal codes are used, tailoring the user experience to their locale.

2. **Geolocation services:** Leverage this data for building out geolocation services in your application, providing localized experiences based on a user's country and subdivision.

3. **Localization of country-specific data:** Use the localized subdivision names and postal code information for translating your UI components or forms based on user location.

## Quick Start

Clone this repo using `git clone --depth=1 <https://github.com/cuttlesoft/countries.json.git> <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>`

Move to the appropriate directory: `cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>`

Start utilizing the data in your web application. Here is an example of how you can use the helper function to fetch data for a specific country:

```javascript
import getCountry from 'countries.json';

// Fetch data for Canada
const canadaData = getCountry('CA');

console.log(canadaData.name); // Outputs: "Canada"
```

Example schema:

```json
{
  "code": "CA",
  "name": "Canada", 
  "division_common_name": "Province", 
  "divisions": {
    "AB": "Alberta",
